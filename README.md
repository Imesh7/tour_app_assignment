## Assignment project

To run the app first run the build runner script to generate the navigation routes

```
dart run build_runner build
```

After , run the project as usual.

I have used Flutter 3.38.3
Dart 3.10.1 to run the project.

### What I have done

- State management implemented using BLoC, ensuring unidirectional data flow

- Dependency injection handled via GetIt, with future extensibility using Injectable

- Responsive layouts achieved using ScreenUtil for consistent UI scaling

- Adopted Clean Architecture with clear separation between presentation, domain, and data layers

- Designed the application with a feature-first modular structure for scalability and maintainability
- Used [auto_route](https://pub.dev/packages/auto_route) for app routing
